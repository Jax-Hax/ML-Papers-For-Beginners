# ML-Resources-For-Beginners
A collection of papers, both famous and recent, to improve/start your knowledge about the AI field. Even if you've never touched AI in your life, you can start here, and I hope to give everything you need.

## Background
I started my AI journey in 2022, wanting to understand how ChatGPT could be so good. It took way longer than I expected, and actually inspired me to become a real AI Researcher! I haven't gotten there yet, but I hope to someday. This is basically a collection of all the resources I used, along with my [100 papers in 100 days](https://github.com/Jax-Hax/100-papers-100-days/blob/main/README.md) repo, which I encourage you to check out if you already somewhat know the field, but you need some starting knowledge for that. Feel free to leave an issue/discussion about new resources, I am always trying to improve! You could also fork this to change the layout, maybe changing it to be subject based instead. I could also eventually make a more sorted website if it is wanted, with categories and difficulty/prerequisites shown.

## Beginner path
If you have never programmed before, I highly suggest the [100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/) course by Angela, it's great and it uses the same programming language that most of AI is in.  
For an intro to deep learning itself, check out the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) course. It's a great intro to the overview of ML using FastAI, with a more advanced Part 2. There is also a book that goes along with it but is a bit more out of date.
